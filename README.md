AIM: 
The aim of this project is to develop a Python program that can analyze a simple card game to determine the winning strategy. We will use a hypothetical card game where two players draw cards from a deck and the player with the higher card wins the round. The goal is to simulate the game, evaluate the strategies, and identify the winning conditions.


PROCEDURE:
1.	Start the program.
2.	Initialize the deck of cards
o	Create a list or array representing all the cards in the deck .
3.	Define the rules of the game
o	Specify how players take turns, how points are scored, and what defines a “winning hand” or move.
4.	Distribute cards to players
o	Use randomization( random.sample()) to deal cards fairly among players.
5.	Implement the game logic
o	Allow each player (or computer) to make moves based on defined rules.
6.	Apply a strategy-finding algorithm
o	Use decision-making logic such as:
	Greedy approach (choosing the highest card)
	Probability-based decision
	Minimax or dynamic programming for optimal strategy
7.	Compare outcomes and determine the winner
o	Evaluate players’ scores or card values.
o	Display the player with the best strategy as the winner.
8.	Display the results
o	Print the moves, final scores, and the winning strategy.
9.	End the program.
